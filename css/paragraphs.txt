                            I have always been around pets since I was a kid and have a passion for caring for them. 
                            Currently away from my three pets back home, two of which are seniors, I have experience administering oral medications. 
                            I give owners daily updates for their comfort.

                            I'm currently on summer break so your baby will have all of my attention.
                            If I'm not at school, all of my time is spent enjoying and taking care of your pet.

                            I was raised around animals, and have since learned how to care for them.
                            I will treat your house with the same respect that I treat my own home.
